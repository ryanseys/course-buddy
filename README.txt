1. The students in your group :

+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------+
| Student # |      Name     |     Carleton Email Address     |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 100817604 | Ryan Seys     | RyanSeys@cmail.carleton.ca     |
| 100819001 | Caleb Simpson | CalebSimpson@cmail.carleton.ca |
| 100815259 | Andrew Oâ€™Hara | AndrewOhara@cmail.carleton.ca  |
+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------+

2. Which program (CE, CSE, SE) did you use to test your application?

Software Engineering (SE)

3. Who is the TA who is assigned to your group ? (Mr. Kazi or Mr. Abaza)?

Mr. Abaza

4. Provide the contributions of each member of the group.

<TODO>

5. Provide a brief description of your folders/files. If your project includes several 
folders, give the content of each folder. If you had separate scripts to implement 
each task in the project, then provide the mapping tasks to html/php files.

<TODO>

6. Provide the instructions to execute when deploying your application to offer the
service to all programs of the Faculty of Engineering. What is the format of data
to provide to your application (for each academic program, for the prerequisite 
trees, for the complementary studies electives, for the basic science electives, for 
the (breadth) engineering electives ? What files in your project will need to be 
modified to include all Engineering programs ? Briefly, describe the changes that 
must be done in the code?

<TODO>

7. Explain how you implement the prerequisite dealing with 3rd year status or 4th
yea status in Engineering and how does your code checks whether a student has 
or not the proper status. Explain how your software processes the perquisites that 
can be taken concurrently with the course (eg. ECOR 4995 must taken at the 
same time as the 4th year project; STAT 2605 and STAT 3502 are prerequisite to 
SYSC 4602, but the STAT can be taken concurrently to SYSC 4602). Explain how 
your application deals with program transfer : For instance, SYSC 2006 requires
either SYSC 1005 or ECOR 1606. Software Eng. requires SYSC 1005, while 
Communications Eng. requires ECOR 1606. A student starting in Software Eng. 
may switch to Communications Eng, or vice versa. How does your software 
determine if the student can take or not SYSC 2006?

<TODO>

8. Explain briefly the rules (or algorithms) 
you use when building the (conflict-free) 
timetable. For instance, a course has currently 2 lectures sessions (A and B) and 2 
lab sessions each (A1, A2, B1, B2); if all are still available, how does your software
select which lecture session and lab to suggest to the student?

<TODO>

9. In your solution, which entity identifies the courses that can be taken based on 
the completed courses and the prerequisites ? The client process or the server 
process? Same question for the determination of the conflict-free timetable? 
Explain your choices.
